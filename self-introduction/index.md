|Hi there!
My name is Olga, I am 36 years old, I am from Ukraine. I want to introduse a little about myself and my hobbies.
So, I am an entrepreneur with 11 years of experience, a mother of a beautiful 16 year old girl, a beloved wife and a beginner front-end developer
Before I started learning frontend development I ran my own business, I worked in the fitness industry, I was engaged in hiring and training personnel, developing marketing, setting plans and developing clubs, and also audited clubs in the city of Odessa and participated in the opening of dozens of clubs as a mentor
 The circumstances were such that in February last year my family and I left Ukraine, I had to close the business and start everything from scratch.
 Basically, from that moment my new life began.
 My friend, who works as a designer in IT, advised me to take SheCodes coding courses for women, this workshop is in English, and I thought it would be great to improve my English at the same time. So exactly a year ago, in the month of May, my acquaintance with html, css and js began.
 And since then, there is not a day that i have not studied some material or improved my skills in this area.
 After 6 months of training, I realized that this is just the beginning, and I need to go deeper, I started looking for schools where I can get specific practice and skills close to the real workflow, in addition to SheCodes courses, I study at the go-it school for a full stack developer , I'm very interested in learning how to interact with the backend, but at the moment I'm learning javascript.
 In March, I returned to Ukraine and opened my online store, in parallel with the courses I study at the excellent Rolling scope school. I perfectly understand that becoming a true professional in my field is a long and difficult path, I am ready for this, I love what I do, I get great pleasure from the fact that I grow as a specialist and am open to new knowledge. I wish you all success in your endeavors and may your dreams come true.|
